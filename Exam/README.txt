This should could contain:

B103565_Qa.py (programme)
2 graphs for part b
1 text file and 1 graph for part c
1 text file and 1 graph for part d
1 text file and 1 graph for part f

The programme is ran using python B103565.py L p nsweeps part

Here part can be any of anim, b, c, d, e, f
These correspond to the respective questions

The data files are standard format of x y error
Exception is part f which has sweeps p=0.6 p=0.625 p=0.65 where each p column is average infected fraction from 20 runs
The average is done for each sweep point

Word answers:

b) They flucuate about different average fraction values.

d) The transition should correspond to the peak in the variance graph, which occurs at 0.55. When running the simulation we see at   0.55 the simulation reaches an absorbing state. Part c graph shows that only at 0.55 is this reached.

f) The graph shows that for higher p the curve is steeper and so reaches a steady state faster.
